# SheShield

**SheShield** is a Python-based safety application designed to enhance women's security by providing multiple emergency features. This app ensures swift communication, real-time updates, and preventive measures in critical situations. 

## Features

### 1. **Emergency Alert and SOS**
   - Users can send emergency alerts and SOS messages directly to their predefined emergency contacts.
   - **Twilio API** is used to send SMS and email notifications instantly, ensuring swift communication in crisis.

### 2. **Local Volunteering System**
   - If an incident occurs, users within a **2-3 km radius** receive a notification, allowing them to respond or report any suspicious behavior.
   - This feature builds a local safety network, encouraging immediate assistance from nearby volunteers.

### 3. **Red and Green Zone Alerts**
   - **Red Zones** are areas with higher crime rates, and users approaching a **500-700m radius** are notified to remain cautious.
   - **Green Zones** are safer areas where fewer incidents have been reported.
   - This geo-alert system keeps users informed about their safety in different areas.

### 4. **Continuous Image Capture**
   - When an emergency alert is triggered, the app continuously captures images.
   - These images are automatically sent to the user’s registered email, providing a real-time record of the event.
   - **Twilio API** is also used for sending these emails, ensuring swift and reliable delivery.

### 5. **MySQL Database Integration**
   - User data, including contact details, red/green zone information, and volunteer responses, are stored securely in a **MySQL** database.
   - This ensures efficient data management, retrieval, and analysis for security purposes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Twilio API** (for SMS and email services)
- **MySQL** (for database management)
- **Geofencing and Location-based Services** (for red/green zone alerts)


3. Set up your **MySQL** database and update the connection credentials in the project configuration.

4. Set up **Twilio API** by creating an account and getting your API credentials:
   - Update the API keys in the project for sending SMS and email notifications.

   ```

2. Register as a user and add emergency contacts.

3. Use the SOS button to send alerts, and experience the app's other safety features.
